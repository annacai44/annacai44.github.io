            <div class="description">
                <p>Many organizations at Northwestern host events with <strong>lots</strong> of free food.
                Oftentimes, when the event ends, lots of food is left over and subsequently thrown out.
                At the same time, many people at Northwestern would <b>run</b> for free food.</p>
                <p>Why waste perfectly good food by throwing it out when there's people who would gladly take it?</p>
            </div>

            <div id="border"></div>

            <h3 class="sectionTitle">The Solution</h3>
            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    FoodFinder is a web application that allows members of the Northwestern community to notify other
                    members of where free food is at on campus. Is there leftover pizza in Norris? Donuts at Tech? Sushi in Mudd?
                    With FoodFinder, less food is wasted, and more stomachs are full.
                </p>
                <h4 class="explanationHeader">How It Works</h4>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <p>
                        Users must first login to FoodFinder using their Northwestern email address. If the email used to sign
                        in is not of a Northwestern domain, the user will not be granted access to use FoodFinder's post features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once logged in, a user can post onto FoodFinder by clicking on the POST button in the navigation bar.
                        The user fills out fields describing the food they're posting, the location they're at on campus, and their name or student
                        organization. Then, they attach a photo of the food and click SUBMIT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user's post is now at the top of FoodFinder's homepage. The user can edit or delete the post. Other logged in users 
                        can also like the user's post. 
                    </p>

                <img alt="React.js logo" src="../files/react.png">
                <img alt="Material UI logo" src="../files/MUI.png">
                <img alt="Node.js logo" src="../files/nodejs.png">
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                <p>The front-end was developed with React and Material UI, and the backend was developed in Node.js using the Express framework. 
                    The data of the posts is stored in a MongoDB database, which allows for CRUD operations to be performed on the posts.
                    The Google OAuth API was also used to ensure that FoodFinder's users were verified Northwestern community members.
